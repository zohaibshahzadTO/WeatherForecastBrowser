# Weather Forecast Browser

<b>Brief Overview:</b>At the top, a user is going to be able to search for a city such as New York or San Francisco, they submit the city by clicking "search here" or enter. We're going to submit a query to a third party API that's going to serve us back forecasted weather data for the next 5 days. Once we get that weather back, we're going to add a row on a table with information about that particular cities forecast for the next 5 days. The user can search for many different cities over time and for each search it'll just add an additional row. The table will consist of the city, and graphs for temperature, pressure and humidity. 

# Challenges

First challenge is figuring out a way to make AJAX request with redux. With redux, we need to centralize all of our logic into reducers and actions as much as possible and instead our react components are only responsible for showing data, they're not responsible for fetching data at all. Second challenge is that we're going to use a third party library to draw the graphs for us and so we need to learn how to work with a react component that has been created by another developer and integrate it into our own project. Third challenge is that we need to figure out how to deal with a redux application where state changes significantly over time. We'll be adding on to cities every time the user searches one. We'll be gathering state over time.
